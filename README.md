# Recommendation-Systems
• DOMAIN: Smartphone, Electronics

• CONTEXT: India is the second largest market globally for smartphones after China. About 134 million smartphones were sold across India
in the year 2017 and is estimated to increase to about 442 million in 2022. India ranked second in the average time spent on mobile web by
smartphone users across Asia Pacific. The combination of very high sales volumes and the average smartphone consumer behaviour has
made India a very attractive market for foreign vendors. As per Consumer behaviour, 97% of consumers turn to a search engine when they
are buying a product vs. 15% who turn to social media. If a seller succeeds to publish smartphones based on user’s behaviour/choice at the
right place, there are 90% chances that user will enquire for the same. This Case Study is targeted to build a recommendation system
based on individual consumer’s behaviour or choice.
